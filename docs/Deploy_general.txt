The document below explains how to build and deploy encore app webservices. 
Build is to be executed in local machine and war file needs to be deployed to AWS VM

Pre-setup for building the project
----------------------------------
1. Node JS
   a. Install node js from https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.17.4/node-v14.17.4-x64.msi


Build
-----
1. Checkout project from github (https://github.com/encoretimeapp/encoretime) to a suitable folder
2. cd to EncoreUO
3. run command: npm install      - Warnings reported in this step can be ignored)
4. run command: npm run build    - Creates a build folder with deployable html/js/css/static files

 
Deployment
----------
1. Create suitable folder in VM
2. Copy contents from deploy folder to VM folder
3. Copy build folder to VM folder (copy as a folder and not files within folder)
4. In VM folder run: npm install
5. In VM folder run: node server.js

Above deployment steps provide information for setting up fresh

AWS VM
------
-> In VM node server.js is setup as systemctl encoreui and is automatically invoked on system startup (sudo systemctl start/stop/status encoreui)
-> EncoreUI project folder has deploy.bat file, when run from same location, it deploys all contents except certs from local machine to VM

-> Folder structure in AWS VM
-----------------------------
Folder path:/data/encoreapp
 |
 |-- build (folder - copied over from local build)
     |-- ... (contents from UI build - html/js/css/static files)
 |-- certs (folder)
     |-- ddddddddddd.pem (certificate file)
	 |-- ddddddddddd.txt (key file)
 |-- deploy.sh        (used for deployment after copying files)
 |-- node_modules     (generated)
 |-- package-lock.json
 |-- package.json
 |-- server.js

--> Settings Customizations 
---------------------------
1. Copy certificate and key file to certs folder, if there are changes in SSL
2. If webservices is hosted in different machine, update EncoreUI\package.json REACT_APP_API_URL to new URL location, build and deploy this project
